    //calls our function to do so (which could be asynchrenous)
    //Idea:
    //State::latch_render() copies the values/data internally needed to render later (meaning we can tick right away afterwards since even if we affect the render settings we have a copy)
    // Or perhaps this returns some sort of FutureFramebuffer object that we can call a render function on, completely seperate from the main State?
    //State::render() returns the rendered framebuffer (the user can call this in a seperate thread)
