# VSEMUR

VSmile EMUlator in Rust

To make things a bit more interesting, I decided to switch my VSEMU project (http://git.jekel.ca/JZJ/VSEMU) to being written in Rust. Not only is this a good excuse to learn Rust, which I would have had to at some point anyways, but also makes the project a bit more novel in comparison to the emulator that already exists in MAME!

Note: When developing this, I try to gleam as much of my understanding of the behaviour of the system/CPU architecture as possible for publically available documentation. However, at times, it becomes
necessary to view MAME's implementation when the documents available are unclear. I try to avoid this as much as possible, and rarely if ever actually copy code verbatim, but to be safe I consider this project to be a partial derivative work of MAME, and am (to the best of my knowledge) following its GPLv2 license properly.

Note: the unSP Programmer's Guide is a very useful PDF that comes with Sunplus/Generalplus's IDE. It was really helpful when working on this.
