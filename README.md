# VSEMUR

VSmile EMUlator in Rust

To make things a bit more interesting, I decided to switch my VSEMU project (http://git.jekel.ca/JZJ/VSEMU) to being written in Rust. Not only is this a good excuse to learn Rust, which I would have had to at some point anyways, but also makes the project a bit more novel in comparison to the emulator that already exists in MAME!
